# ExpressionTree
code can be compiled in a linux environment with the following command:
g++ Hill_PA2.cpp
execution of program is then done with a string input using the following command:
./a.out "4 * 3 + 4"
In its current state the expression evaluation is not working. I have not been able to debug the program.
